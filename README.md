# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
This SVG logo generator was created to allow users to make an SVG logo simply by answering four questions. This project taught me:

* How to use modularization to separate my functionality
* How to import and use the file system to write new files, and export them to use in other files
* How to create objects using class constructors and add methods to them
* How to use promises to execute functions
* How to use Inquirer to ask questions in the terminal
* How to use Jest to test if the shapes would take in the color set to them

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
To use the SVG logo generator, make sure Node.js is installed. From there, navigate to the application in the terminal and use 'node index' to start up the prompts. Follow the prompts with valid inputs and then your logo file will be created.
